# Week-3-Challenge

I am resubmitting this project due to errors made in my last submission where i hadn't made sure whether the CSS and JS files were connected on the html page, My tast was to code the java script of this Password Generator, my criteria that i followed was:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

due to not having done this i used support through Youtube Tutorials, the videos i had watched were:
